# MXNet version of InsightFace-REST service.

This version is fully based on original InsightFace [python package](https://github.com/deepinsight/insightface/tree/master/python-package).
It can be used as example of using InsightFace python package over REST API, but is currently depreciated.

For latest version optimized with TensorRT see [src/api_trt](https://github.com/SthPhoenix/InsightFace-REST/tree/master/src/api_trt).
